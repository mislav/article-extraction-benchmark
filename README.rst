Article extraction is a task of extracting certain fields of an article
(e.g. news or blog post), such as headline, article body, publication date,
authors, etc. Article extraction systems must work on any web-site.
Here we evaluate only the article body field, as this is one of the most important fields
and one of the hardest to get right.

Below you can find more details about the packages and result reproduction.

More details
------------

More details are available:

- In the whitepaper at https://www.zyte.com/whitepaper-ebook/in-depth-analysis-and-evaluation-on-the-quality-of-article-body-extraction/
- In a technical report attached to the v1.0.0 release at
  https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark/releases/tag/v1.0.0

Installation
------------

Clone this repo, and use Python 3.6+.

Evaluation does not require any dependencies.
Dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt`` are only for re-generating
output files for open-source article extraction libraries.
See below for their installation details.

Data
----

JSON data format: a dictionary which maps item ids to dictionaries,
with the following fields:

- ``articleBody``: text of the article
- ``url``: page url (optional)

All files should have the same keys.
Ground truth is in ``ground-truth.json``,
predictions from different systems is in ``output/*.json`` files.

HTML files are in ``html`` folder. They were fetched with Splash headless
browser with JS disabled by default. They are gzip-compressed and utf-8 encoded.

Screenshots of all pages are not in the repo, they are available on github
in the "Releases" section: https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark/releases

Open-source libraries
---------------------

In addition to benchmarking AutoExtract and Diffbot services, we also benchmark several
open-source libraries that work directly on HTML files without a need for rendering
or external resources:

- newspaper4k: https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k
- readability-lxml: https://github.com/buriy/python-readability
- dragnet: https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet
- boilerpipe: https://github.com/misja/python-boilerpipe
- html-text: https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/html-text -
  this is a baseline which extracts the full text of HTML page
- trafilatura: https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura contributed by the author
  at https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark/pull/4
- go-trafilatura: https://github.com/markusmobius/go-trafilatura
- go-readability: https://github.com/go-shiori/go-readability
- readeck/go-readability: https://codeberg.org/readeck/go-readability/src/branch/main/FORK.md
- Readability.js: https://github.com/mozilla/readability
- Go-DomDistiller: https://github.com/markusmobius/go-domdistiller
- news-please: https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please
- Goose3: https://github.com/goose3/goose3
- inscriptis: https://github.com/weblyzard/inscriptis -
  converts HTML to text with a particular emphasis on nested tables
- html2text: https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text -
  converts HTML pages to Markup language
- jusText: https://github.com/miso-belica/jusText -
  Heuristic based boilerplate removal tool
- BeautifulSoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ -
  Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

Output from these libraries is already present in the repo in ``output/*.json`` files.
They were generated with ``extractors/run_*.py`` files.

You can re-generate output JSON files with:

    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    make run-all

This will install Python dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` into a
`virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_

Evaluation
----------

For evaluation, run::

    python3 evaluate.py

We report precision, recall, F1, accuracy and their standard deviation estimated with bootstrap.
